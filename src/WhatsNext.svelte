  <p>The project will take a bit of a break, some small website updates might happen during that time.</p>
  <p>
    A print run is in continual consideration but is not anticipated to occur any time soon - we'd like to catch up more
    to the in-game cards.

    We did actually <a href="https://twitter.com/alecatmew/status/1578373911892226048">playtest IRL tableturf</a>, but
    since the game now offers multiplayer the focus of the project has pivoted away from making it a practical Print
    &amp; Play game.
  </p>
  <p>We may add rulebook and play board print files at a later date.</p>
